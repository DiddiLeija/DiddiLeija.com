## The Minecraft's Wild Update!

Maybe I got a bit late to publish this, but I'll do it. The Minecraft's [Wild Update]() is here!
I just want to celebrate it, and try out the new features :)

Maybe the thing that I enjoyed the most is... the Warden (with the forgs in the second place). So
I took a GIF from the update's official downloadables and pasted it here:
