## Python EOL'ed versions dropper reminder

I usually forget the things I should do. That's why I love GitHub project boards, because
they help me get organized. Today, I created a board to organize the Python dropping job for
my own projects. I added a few useful notes to get even more organized, too.

You can see this new project board [here](https://github.com/users/DiddiLeija/projects/5).
