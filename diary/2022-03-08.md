## Python EOL'ed versions dropper reminder

I usually forget the things I should do. That's why I love GitHub project boards, because
they help me get organized. Today, I created a board to organize the Python dropping job for
my own projects. I added a few useful notes to get even more organized, too.

You can see this new project board [here](https://github.com/users/DiddiLeija/projects/5).

## A new project is coming: Diddi Platforms

I just started to work on the next game for the [Diddi Games Collection](https://itch.io/c/1927005/diddi-games-collection), it
is called **Diddi Platforms**, and it's a platformer game made with Pyxel. A lot of things will happen until this
game can be used publicly, so I have a lot of work now.
