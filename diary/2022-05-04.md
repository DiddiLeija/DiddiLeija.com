## May the 4th...

Today it's **Star Wars day!** Woo hoo!

_(Yeah, I know, this is absolutely unrelated to programming, designing, and that stuff, but... I can't help posting this! :P)._

## Resurrecting some forgotten projects

I left a few projects forgotten, like [*Control de Agua*](https://github.com/ControlDeAgua) (which is actually a personal
effort to help my local folks), [*aleat3*](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/aleat3) (which I left for an unknown reason), and
mabe a few others. So, I have the intention to work again on them, and maybe convert them into valuable projects!

## Keep modding with Minecraft

I'm still learning to use the Minecraft interfaces and mods, and I'm having fun in the process (though I'm a bit afraid of
the new agressive cows I made). And all what I've made is thanks to the open-source docs exposed at
[docs.microsoft.com/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/). That's something I love of open source: all what you
need is there, and everyone can access to it.
