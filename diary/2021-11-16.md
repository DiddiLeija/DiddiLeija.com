## Ah, Kotlin!

As a developer, I like to expand my horizons... I usually write code for desktop
users. That's cool, but sometimes, "cool" is not enough for me...

But now, I've just started with a new programming language... **Kotlin**. I
started with a [course](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course),
offered by [Google](https://grow.google), that teach you to
code with Kotlin. With that knowledge, now I can write **Android apps**!

So now, you will probably find Kotlin projects livin' in my GitHub account in the future!
