## New badges on GitHub!

Maybe it's not a fresh new, but it's totally new to me. Today I visited [my GitHub profile page](https://github.com/DiddiLeija),
and noticed some new drawings behind my info. I clicked on them and I discovered [the new badges](https://github.com/DiddiLeija?tab=achievements)!

They are cool to me. As always, the GitHub team improved themselves :)
