## Going a bit slower?

Yeah, I know, I've been going a bit slower on GitHub recently. The main reason is the lack
of time due to out-of-screen stuff. Do not worry, I'm still here (hold on... does anybody
care for that?). Anyway, I'm gonna try to speed the things up ;)

## Uploading some Arduino code

I wanna upload some Arduino experiments I made a while ago. Probably, the experiments will be
located at [DiddiLeija/dirty-experiments](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/dirty-experiments), in
a separate section. Well, I hope so.
