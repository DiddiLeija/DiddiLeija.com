## [GameOff 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021): The end has come!

After 2 months of working, coding, rating and fixing, the end of the event has just come. Today, they published
the results (see [here](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021/results)). I know, my game is not on the first pages
(he he)... It ranked **278th**. Only 7 people rated. But I don't feel bad -- there were 530 entries on the jam :p

It was a really cool experience, I've never published a game before. I had fun.
And btw, I wanna keep working on [Diddi and the Bugs](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and-the-bugs)
in the near future, so I have a long way in front of me. Contributions welcome!

Also, thanks Alexandra, [your idea](https://diddileija.github.io/diary/2021-11-13) pushed us far enough! :D

## Turning into Rust

I was just... hanging around [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel), and found a language completely new for me:
[Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)). It is somehow similar to C++, but I haven't hear
about it before. It looks interesting, so I'm looking to learn more about it, and maybe upload something to
[dirty-experiments](https://diddileija.github.io/projects/dirty_experiments)!

## [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com): Moving up the ranks... slowly

Recently, I started to participate a bit more on StackExchange communities... to do something on my free time. However, I
started to go a bit higher in the ranks (yay!).

On [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/16246013/diego-ramirez), I'm now the
[59% overall](https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/alltime/stackoverflow/2008-07-31/16246013#16246013). That's not a big thing,
but I feel fine with that.

And with [StackOverflow in spanish](https://es.stackoverflow.com/users/254650/diego-ramirez) (where I've been more active), I'm
the [73% in the quarter](https://stackexchange.com/leagues/637/quarter/es-stackoverflow/2022-01-01/254650#254650). Again, nothing
extraordinary, but it's the best I got there in a really long time!
