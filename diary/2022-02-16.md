## More information about my Ko-fi page

In my [last page from my diary](2022-02-15), I announced my new [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/diddileija).
But today I wanna give more information about this, without editing yesterday post...

First of all, as an open source developer, I enabled this "buy me a coffee" dynamic, because I don't get any
other monetary payment. So, I would appreciate any tip you could leave me!

Then, let's talk about money. First, by the moment, I can only receive money to a credit card (no PayPal for now,
sorry). Also, due to some legal issues in my country, I registered with [Stripe](https://stripe.com) with my
father's account and data (we made that decision together). Anyway, you can be sure that your tip will only support
my developer career. And, maybe, you can help me buy a coffee for the weekend :P

Finally, if you don't know who I am, here's a [small resume](../profile) of my developer work. Also, you can visit my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/DiddiLeija).
