# DiddiLeija.github.io

Source code for my personal website, currently named [`DiddiLeija.github.io`](http://diddileija.github.io).
I will be working here to build something cool to describe myself.

<!---
-- Removed, I'm not sure if I'll move from github.io! (Reason: I have no money) --

_(This will eventually move to an independent site, but it will stay inside `github.io` until I get a DNS provider on my region :sweat_smile:)_

## Jekyll theme

I am using the Jekyll theme [`hacker`](http://github.com/pages-themes/hacker) from the standard `pages-themes`
to give my dark, elegant personallity to my custom page, you know...

## Improvements

I might do glitchy things or something like that (I hope I won't, but who knows)... so if you find something
I can improve on my site, please tell me via an [issue](http://github.com/diddileija/diddileija.github.io/issues)
or propose a fix with a [pull request](http://github.com/diddileija/diddileija.github.io/pulls)!
