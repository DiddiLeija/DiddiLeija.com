## [GameOff 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021): My project is alive!

Ok, I confess that I got a bit late to publish this, but now my [GameOff 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021) submission is getting developed
on a GitHub repository (see it grow [here](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and-the-bugs)).
I also want to say thanks to **Alexandra Marquez**, a good friend who helped me to decide a storyline for my game. Without
her idea, I would be stuck now, crying because I didn't have an idea...

## DiddiParser (2)

A few months ago, I left a project named **DiddiParser** abandoned. But less than a week ago, I decided to take that brilliant
idea back from death, but now with a more standardised aspect, and new features. I named the project... **DiddiParser 2**. Its
documentation is now available [here](diddiparser2.readthedocs.io/en/latest), and a pre-release will be uploaded to PyPI... soon.
