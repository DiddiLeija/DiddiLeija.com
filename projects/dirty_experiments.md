# `dirty-experiments` - My dirty, miscellaneous experiments of programming

Follow my programming, miscellaneous experiments of programming on this new
repository! There, I will post a lot of examples from different programming
languages, and a corresponding README to explain them. Some of them are more like...
funny features of each language. Other times, they are explanative examples.
Anyway, I'm sure you're gonna love them! 

_Join me on this programming adventure!_
