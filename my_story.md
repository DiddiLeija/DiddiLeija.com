# My programming story

Actually, I'm don't have a really long time of programming. But let's see how did I started to write programs.

***

I always loved technology, even before I started to learn programming. I remember that, around **2017 and 2019**, my robotics teacher
(yea, I was learning robotics as an extra course) showed me how to use [Java](http://www.java.com) and Pascal on simple programs,
using "Karel the Robot". I think that's where I started to get interesed in programming. But I didn't go ahead on that for a long time.

I started (seriously) on **June 2020**, when I tried an online course named "[Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/welcome)",
by the University of Michigan. I completed it, and then, I wanted to extend my Python knowledge.

But nothing happened (at least, at the web), until **May 3, 2021**, when I signed
in at [GitHub](https://github.com). After that, I started to learn advanced stuff,
and then I started to contribute to the OSS world...

The first repo where I did something was [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip). No,
seriously, I started my contributor career with the pip team. I've been on several
places after that, but I can't tell you all of them now... Some highlights can be found [here, at my "Project list"](projects).

***

At **November 2021**, I joined my first game jam: [GameOff 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021).
Well, I didn't get so far, but I had fun. And I keep participating in such things.

**Currently**, I'm haging around some projects, hacking and learning.
