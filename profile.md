# My programmer profile (or something like that)

It is a bit complicated to make me fit into a simple, short profile. Anyway, I am talking about
my "general" programmer story, not about GitHub profile \(for that, go [here](http://github.com/diddileija)\).

## Programming languages

- My first programming language: **Pascal**. Yeah, this obsolete language is, officially, my first programming language.
- My favorite programming language: **Python**. Of course that I love Python!
- All the languages I can handle:
  - Python
  - Pascal
  - Java
  - JavaScript
  - C
  - C++
  - HTML \(Hummm... is this exactly a language? I'm not sure at all\)
  - SQL

## \(Real\) languages that I use for programming

\(I mean: _Spanish, English, Japanese_, etc.\)

- 90% **English**. Most of my public \(and private\) repositories are made in English.
- 10% **Spanish**. Even when it is my native language, I don't use it a lot for programming \(just with local projects\).

## Programming branches

Those that I use, in order of preference:

1. **GUIs**. I love making things that the others can see, you know.
2. **Packaging**. Most of my public repos and my public contributions are about packages. I like making things that any other developer can download and use.
3. **Web programming**. I'm not an expert at all, but I like it.
4. **Databases**. Well... I'm not a "huge fan" of doing databases, but I can do it.
