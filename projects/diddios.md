# DiddiOS - A developer-friendly OS based on Linux

This is one of my **biggest projects ever**. I am planning to develop a Linux-based OS, but with more developer
functions, and safer. Maybe it won't work, but I would like to try!

I have a GitHub organization to organize the work. View it [here](https://github.com/DiddiOS).

The future website for DiddiOS is [here](https://diddios.github.io).
