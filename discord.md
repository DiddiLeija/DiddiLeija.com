# DiddiLeija's Server

A while back in the 2022, I created a Discord server (inaugurated as _DiddiLeija Games Server_
and then renamed to _DiddiLeija's Server_) for chatting about my projects and getting in touch
with my collaborators and contributors. It's totally free and safe to join.

**If you want to join, here's an invite link I made a while back: [discord.gg/DfrHxT9ENy](https://discord.gg/DfrHxT9ENy).**

## Gaining VIP access

Though most of the content in my server is free to everyone (such as general text/voice channels and 
project-focused channels), you can gain access to a few special channels:

- `#polls`, a channel for participating in polls about the future of my projects.
- `#wips`, where you can see the most anticipated WIPs.

To gain access to these channels, you must earn a server role. To gain one, you can either contribute 
with a commit, [leave me a tip](./kofi), providing feedback on my stuff, or via ocasional opportunities.
