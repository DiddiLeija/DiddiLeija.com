# My programming story

Actually, I'm don't have a really long time of programming :laughing:. But let's see how did I started to write programs.

I started on **June 2020**, when I tried an online course named "[Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/welcome)", 
by the University of Michigan. I completed it, and then, I wanted to extend my Python knowledge.

For something more than 6 months, I were programming _a lot_ of personal projects, just to have fun. On that period, I
created these public projects:

- [aleat1](http://github.com/diddileija/aleat1)
- [aleat2](http://github.com/diddileija/aleat2)
- [aleat3](http://github.com/diddileija/aleat3)

_\(You can also see them on [PyPI](pypi.org)\)._

In all that process, I read the whole [Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/3.8). (No, I'm serious, I did it).

On **December, 2020**, I tooked several [Python courses on Spanish](http://capacitateparaelempleo.org) to certificate and extend my knowledge. That's where
I found the power of GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces)... Since that day, I haven't stopped of making GUIs.

On **March 2021**, I started to offer my work to my local community (planning websites, building Windows applications, etc.).

But then, something special happened on **May, 2021**: I started to use [GitHub](http://github.com/diddileija)! Since that, 
I've been growing, and growing, and growing. From **May 2021 to June 2021**, I've been collaborating with this external projects:

- [pypa/pip](http://github.com/pypa/pip)

I also created this repos:

- [DiddiParser](http://github.com/diddileija/diddiparser)
- [text_formatter](http://github.com/diddileija/text_formatter)

**In the present day**, I've been looking for something new, and I'm open to any opportunity.
