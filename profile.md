# My programmer profile (or something like that)

Here you can read some details and highlights of my developer profile. It's more like a
"fun facts list", though.

## Programming languages

- Languages I already know:
  - Python
  - C++
  - C (barely)
  - JavaScript (barely)
- Languages I want to learn:
  - Kotlin
  - Rust
- Languages I've forgotten:
  - Pascal
  - Java

## Spoken languages that I use for programming

The percentages aren't a _real_ amount, they're just to give you an idea of how much do I use them.

- 60% **English**. Most of my public (and private) repositories are made in English.
- 40% **Spanish**. Even when it is my native language, I don't use it a lot for programming
  (just with local projects). I also sometimes translate some programming stuff to Spanish.

## Programming branches

_In order of preference_:

1. **Game development**. It's more a hobby than a job, but I love it
2. **Packaging**. I've been working on packaging for a long time, and I really like it.
3. **GUIs**. I love making things visible for everyone, you know.
4. **Web programming**. I'm not an expert at all, but I like it.
5. **Databases**. I'm not a "huge fan" of doing databases, but I can do it.

_In order of usage_:

1. **Packaging**. I am currently working to find a way to improve in this area.
2. **Game development**. I'm constantly improving my current games and creating new ones.
3. **GUIs**. I make GUIs for some business locally.
4. **Databases**. I don't like them, but my community needs databases for their jobs.
5. **Web programming**. I create personal projects with JavaScript or just HTMLs.

## Organizations

Those organizations that I've joined.

- **[PyPA](https://pypa.io)**: I am collaborating with [`pip`](http://pip.pypa.io) on [trivial changes](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues?q=author%3ADiddiLeija) and I give attention to some issues from newcomer users. I think PyPA has strongly contributed to my programming progress. Now, I'm helping with some other PyPA-regulated repositories, too.
- **[Winterbloom](https://winterbloom.com)**: I'm part of the Winterbloom team because of [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes), which is now part of this organization.

## Fact: _Why "DiddiLeija"?_

Some people (or many?) may ask: _"Who or what is 'Diddi'?", "Why are you using an image of a masked person in your profiles?"_, and
_"Where does 'DiddiLeija' came from?"_ I'll give you the answers now and here.

I love programming, but I also like drawing: I like to draw and write comics.

One of my characters is named **`Diddi`**. He wears
a dark mask, black suit and a green backpack. On my comics, Diddi is a digital hero from the future, that hides himself from the rest of the people by using
a metal mask. I have to admit it: _I loved Diddi from the first time._

So, when I started to share code with the world, I decided to take the name, and I made some changes to it (I added "Leija", which is a spanish surname).
After that, "DiddiLeija" appears... To keep the personality of Diddi, I selected the Jekyll theme `hacker` for my website.

If you're interested in Diddi, feel free to read [its entry from my wiki](./wiki/Diddi).

Now, I think you'll understand more things about me and this site, right?
