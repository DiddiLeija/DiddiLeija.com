# My programming story

Actually, I'm don't have a really long time of programming. But let's see how did I started to write programs.

***

I always loved technology, even before I started to learn programming. I remember that, from **2017 to 2019**, my robotics teacher
showed me how to use [Java](http://www.java.com) and Pascal on simple programs,
using a program named "Karel el Robot" (you can try it in the web using [Karel.js](https://omegaup.com/karel.js/)\).
I think that's where I started to get interesed in programming. But I didn't go ahead on that for a long time.

I started (seriously) on **June 2020**, when I tried an online course named "[Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/welcome)",
by the University of Michigan. I completed it, and then, I wanted to extend my Python knowledge.

But nothing happened (at least, at the web), until **May 3, 2021**, when I signed
in at [GitHub](https://github.com). After that, I started to learn advanced stuff,
and then I started to contribute to the OSS world...

The first repo where I did something was [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip). No,
seriously, I started my contributor career with the pip team. I've been on several
places after that, but I can't tell you all of them now... Some highlights:

- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io)
- [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes)
- [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)

At **November 2021**, I joined my first game jam: [GameOff 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021).
Well, [I didn't get so far](diary/2022-01-03#gameoff-2021-the-end-has-come), but I had fun. And I hope it won't
be the last competition where I participate.
