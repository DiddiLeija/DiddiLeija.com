## StackOverflow: The top 2% of the month!

Yesterday, I got surprised when StackOverflow told me that I was in the top 2% of the
_quarter_. But today, I opened StackOverflow, and... surprise! I was in the
[top 2% of the month](https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/month/stackoverflow/2021-10-01/16246013#16246013).
For me, this is very special. As I said yesterday, I want to say **THANKS** to those that supported me!

## GitHub Universe: I'm in retrospective

Did you have time to join any of the **GitHub Universe 2021** sessions? They were very instructive, I
recognize. It was also exciting, the **Keynotes** gave us highlights of the newest features of GitHub!
Another great thing from the Universe were the **Live Q&A** sessions. Or what about the **On Demand sessions**?

I want to make a shoutout for **everybody behind the event**, and say "Congrats!". Everything was excellent
for me, and I'll be waiting for the next Universe!
