# Find me on the Internet

As a developer, you can find me on several places, but I'll suggest you some
good places to see my activity and stuff.

## [GitHub](https://github.com)

Probably, GitHub is the most visited place by me. I have some repositories there, and that's were I made
my first contributions to the world... And I'm still working on projects hosted on GitHub.

You can find me as **@DiddiLeija**. [See my GitHub profile here](https://github.com/DiddiLeija).

## Sites inside [Python.org](https://python.org)

I have some accounts on many sites hosted by `python.org`. I listed them:

- [discuss.python.org](https://discuss.python.org/u/diddileija/summary)
- [bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/user39951)
- [python.org](https://www.python.org/users/DiddiLeija/)

(I'm also a PSF member).

## [PyPI](https://pypi.org)

I upload my packages to PyPI. My user profile is [here](https://pypi.org/user/DiddiLeija/).

## [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) communities

<a href="https://stackexchange.com/users/21969270/diego-ramirez"><img src="https://stackexchange.com/users/flair/21969270.png" width="208" height="58" alt="profile for Diego Ramirez on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites" title="profile for Diego Ramirez on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites" /></a>

I use those communities to ask and answer questions. The full list of communities can be found [here](https://stackexchange.com/users/21969270/diego-ramirez?tab=accounts).

## [itch.io](https://itch.io)

I want to upload games on that platform. You can see my dedicated page [here](https://diddileija.itch.io/).

## [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/)

Yeah, I have a developer account on Google. See it [here](https://developers.google.com/profile/u/116698410132405877660).

## [Discord](https://discord.com)

Initially, I created a Discord account to join the [Winterbloom](https://winterbloom.com/) server to chat about [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes),
but you can ping me with a DM. Find me as `DiddiLeija#6744`.

## [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

I logged in there for some reason, I think. Find me [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/diddileija).

## Of course, [this site](https://DiddiLeija.github.io)!

How to find it? Well, you are already on it... This site exists to show my existence in the mighty universe...
