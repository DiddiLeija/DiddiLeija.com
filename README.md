# DiddiLeija.github.io

Source code for my personal website (maybe), that must be
named `DiddiLeija.github.io`. I will be working here to
build something cool to describe myself. 

I want to use the Jekyll theme [`hack`](http://github.com/pages-themes/hacker)
to give my style to my custom page, you know.
