# DiddiLeija.github.io

Source code for my personal website (maybe), that must be
named `DiddiLeija.github.io`. I will be working here to
build something cool to describe myself. 

I want to use the Jekyll theme [`hacker`](http://github.com/pages-themes/hacker)
to give my personallity to my custom page, you know...

As I'm getting new to GitHub pages, I might do glitchy things and something like that :sweat_smile:, so if you find
somewhere I can improve my site, please tell me via an [issue](http://github.com/diddileija/diddileija.github.io/issues)
or a [pull request](http://github.com/diddileija/diddileija.github.io/pulls)
