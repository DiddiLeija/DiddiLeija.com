## Overview

On the present day, there are 3 "major" OS (Operative Systems) around the world:

- **Windows** (we are going to talk about **Windows 11** for now)
- **macOS** (it used to be named **OS X**)
- **Linux** (this includes [a lot of different flavours](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/) and derivations)

They are pretty different, and they have their own "pros and cons" when you want to write code on them.
On this article, we'll talk about those differences.

## Windows

Windows is an OS developed by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/). Its latest version is **Windows 11** _(last verified: **02/02/2022**)_.

### Windows pros

- **Its pathnames are easy to handle (most of the times)**. Most of their files are based in a single disk drive (commonly `C:/`). That makes easier to
  work with paths. Also, external units (aka USB drives) are handled like a separate disk drive (`D:/`, `E:/`, `F:/`, etc.).
- **It is easy to get most of the professional apps**. I mean, _Office_ apps, _Adobe_ apps, etc. Also, it is easier to find programmer tools on Windows.

### Windows cons

- **It is _very sensitive_ with the user permissions**. If you are a programmer, you should notice this point. By itself, Windows 10 doesn't let you modify
  files outside the user directory (`C:/Users/[your username]`). Even if you are the administrator of the system, you may have to explicitely provide
  the permissions to many of your programs.
- **Windows _always_ wants to download programs from the Microsoft Store**. At the first sight, this looks like a security advantage. But sometimes the programs
  from the MStore are different from the program official website. For example, see my [Article 2](article-02).
- **If a newer OS "generation" is released, it is hard to do the transition**. A clear example was the transition from Windows 7 to Windows 8, and then
  to Windows 10. If you search this on a browser, you'll find many stories of people dealing with the transitions.

## macOS

This OS was developed by [Apple Inc.](http://apple.com). Its latest version is named **macOS Monterey** _(last verified: **02/02/2022**)_.

### macOS pros

- **It is really easy to upgrade it**. You don't have to do a big transition, because it doesn't make incompatible changes. Actually, you don't have to buy the OS
  again!
- **It is developer-friendly**. macOS provides several programmer tools, like a command bash, an Objective-C API, and much more.
- **It doesn't have problems to save files in the cloud and the computer (at the same time)**. This makes your work easier.

### macOS cons

- **Sometimes, you can get confused by its paths**. The macOS paths are a bit more complex than the Windows paths. Anyway, you don't have to worry a lot for this.

## Linux

Many of the Linux flavors (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian... and much more) are maintained by many organizations.
The kernel was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds).
When we say "Linux", we are refering to the group of operative systems based on that kernel.

### Linux pros

- **It is strong against viruses**. It is stronger than other OS (Windows, macOS), as far as I know.
- **It is developer-friendly**. Most of the times, it is very easy to handle, so developers feel fine when using a Linux machine!

### Linux cons

- **In some cases, it is hard to distribute software compatible with all the Linux flavors**. A simple example is the Python packages problem. I'll try to explain
  it: each OS has tags to be compatible with some built distributions ([wheel](https://packaging.python.org/glossary/?highlight=wheel#term-Wheel)). But there are _a lot_
  of Linux tags, so it is hard to identify them.
- **It is not so popular than other OS**. So, it may be hard to find useful documents about it.
