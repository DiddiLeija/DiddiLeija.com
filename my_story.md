# My programming story

<!-- NOTE: There's a chance that I'll remove this page and instead write a longer, detailed article. -->

I don't have a really long time as a coder. But let's see how did I started.

***

I always loved tech, even before I started to learn programming. I remember that, around **2017 and 2019**, my robotics teacher
teached me how to use [Java](http://www.java.com) and Pascal on a basic way,
using the Karel interface. I think that's where I started to get interesed in programming. But I didn't go ahead on that for a long time.

I started (seriously) on **June 2020**, when I tried the online course [Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/welcome),
by the University of Michigan. I completed it, and then, I wanted to extend my Python knowledge.

But nothing happened (at least, in the web), until **May 3, 2021**, when I signed
in at [GitHub](https://github.com) for learning purposes. After that, I started to learn advanced stuff,
and then I started to contribute to the open source community.

The first repo where I did something was [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip). I've been on a few other
places after that, and some highlights can be found [here, at my "Project list"](projects).

At **November 2021**, I joined my first game jam: [GameOff 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021).
That's also the time when I got involved in videogame development (something I'm still doing) and when
I created one of my first decent projects, [Diddi and the Bugs](wiki/Diddi_and_the_Bugs).

**And currently**, I'm haging around some projects, hacking and still learning to be more helpful.
