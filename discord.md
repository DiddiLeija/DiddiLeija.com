# DiddiLeija's Server

A while back in the 2022, I created a Discord server (inaugurated as _DiddiLeija Games Server_
and then renamed to _DiddiLeija's Server_) for chatting about my projects and getting in touch
with my collaborators and contributors. It's totally free and safe to join.

**If you want to join, here's an invite link I made a while back: [discord.gg/DfrHxT9ENy](https://discord.gg/DfrHxT9ENy).**

If you would like to learn more about my server before joining, then keep reading!

## What do we do in _DiddiLeija's Server_?

Mostly, I get in touch with collaborators, send news, organize new projects/events, etc.

## Server safety

Yup. I want this server to be a safe place. That's why I've set a bunch of rules/moderation tools to avoid issues.
You can read the behavior rules I've set in the `#rules` channel, in the server.

For example, I've integrated the [YAGPDB.xyz](https://yagpdb.xyz) bot for automated moderation operations, like reports
or automoderation. Discord automatically verifies if each message's content is safe, no matter which role you have.
You can also send our custom report command to let me know if something's going wrong!

## Gaining roles

Though most of the content in my server is free to everyone (such as general text/voice channels and 
project-focused channels), you can gain access to a few special channels:

- `#polls`, a channel for participating in polls about the future of my projects.
- `#wips`, where you can see the most anticipated WIPs.

To gain access to these channels, you must earn a **server role**. To gain one, you can either contribute 
with a commit (_Project Contributor_), [leave me a tip](./kofi) (_Ko-fi Supporter_), providing feedback on my stuff
(_Market Study Participant_), via ocasional opportunities, etc..
