If you have some money in your pocket, and you want to help me with a tip, you're in
the right place! [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com) is a safe, known place for supporting people.
I joined, in case somebody wants to leave me a tip. I would **really** appreciate that!


## Who I am

I'm Diego, better known as... **DiddiLeija**!

I'm a coder, drawer, writer, videogame player, food lover, etc... I like to do open-source
stuff, create some comics, and help with anything else I could give. I entered the Internet
in 2021, when I registered to GitHub. Since that, I've been working on some open source projects,
like [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) and [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes).

You can check a few pages about me, if you want to known who I am:

- [My GitHub profile](https://github.com/DiddiLeija)
- [My website](https://diddileija.github.io). I would like to point some specific pages in there:
  - [My "profile" page](profile)
  - [My little programmer story](my_story)
  - [My diary](diary) <!-- Or should it be... "journal"? I think I made a BIG mistake here :/ -->
  - [A page with places to find me](find_me) (In case you want to see other profiles)
