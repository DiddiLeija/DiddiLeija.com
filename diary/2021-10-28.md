## Hold on: this is my first diary page!

Yep, and I'm very excited. If I have something important (in programming, of course)
I will post it here. Just to save some special (or weird) events.

## GitHub Universe: Day 2

Look at that! The [**GitHub Universe**](https://githubuniverse.com/2021) event is going to finish! I enjoyed many events,
specially the **Live Q&A**s, like those presented by the [**ReadME Project**](https://github.com/readme).

I thnk I learned many new strategies. Probably, you will see them on my code later...

## StackOverflow: I'm the 2% best of the quarter?

I got a big surprise today: I was roaming around StackOverflow, and saw: `Top 2% this quarter`. I entered
the [StackExchange ratings](https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/quarter/stackoverflow/2021-10-01/16246013#16246013), and...
oh my god! I'm on the list!

I'm quite new to StackOverflow (and, well, the StackExchange communities), so I would like to say **THANKS** to all those
users that helped me. Each vote, each "answer selection", all of that is very appreciated by me.

## Hello, Pyxel!

What a day! I've been doing a lot of things today (something that doesn't happen frequently!). I started to "play" with a
game creation package: [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel). As you might know, I'm a fan of retro games. So when I saw
the things Pyxel can do... I told [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io) to install the package, to start creating retro games!

However, I don't want to forget [Pygame](https://pygame.org). It is a cool engine too :)
