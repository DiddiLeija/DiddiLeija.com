If you have some money in your pocket, and you want to help me with a tip, you're in
the right place! [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com) is a safe, known place for supporting people.
I joined, in case somebody wants to leave me a tip. I would **really** appreciate that!


## Who I am

I'm Diego, better known as... **DiddiLeija**!

I'm a coder, drawer, writer, videogame player, food lover, etc... I like to do open-source
stuff, draw cartoons, and help with anything else I can. I entered the Internet
in 2021, when I registered to GitHub. Since that, I've been working on some open source projects,
like [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) and [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes).

You can check a few pages about me, if you want to known who I am:

- [My GitHub profile](https://github.com/DiddiLeija)
- [My website](https://diddileija.github.io). I would like to point some specific pages in there:
  - [My "profile" page](profile)
  - [My little programmer story](my_story)
  - [My diary](diary) <!-- Or should it be... "journal"? I think I made a BIG mistake here :/ -->
  - [A page with places to find me](find_me) (In case you want to see other profiles)

## Introducing my Ko-fi page

Yeah, I have a Ko-fi page. You can visit that page with the button below:

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/G2G3AL6D6)

Ko-fi is a page where people connects with their supporters, via tips, commissions,
shop items, and more.

If you're unfamiliar to Ko-fi, check out this [introduction article](https://help.ko-fi.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004000994-What-is-Ko-fi-).
You can also navigate the [Ko-fi's help portal](https://help.ko-fi.com/).
I'd suggest you to visit the [supporters FAQ](https://help.ko-fi.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003475153-Supporter-Help).

## Why to support me?

Well... nobody's paying me to code or draw. Anyway, I'm still here, because I want to.
So, if you want to say "thanks" with your cents, you'll help me keep doing this :)

## Payment details

I used [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to receive the tips. No PayPal tips are available
by now, sorry. Due to some legal issues in my country, I registered with Stripe with
my fatherâ€™s account and data (btw, we took that decision together). Anyway, you can be
sure that your tip will only support my developer career. And, maybe, you can help me
buy a coffee for the weekend :P

Each "coffee" costs **$1 (one dollar)**. The cost of commissions and shop items (if
they exist) will vary, depending on each product.
