# DiddiLeija.github.io

Source code for my personal website,
named [`DiddiLeija.github.io`](http://diddileija.github.io). I will be working here to
build something cool to describe myself. 

## The Jekyll theme

I am using the Jekyll theme [`hacker`](http://github.com/pages-themes/hacker) from the standard `pages-themes`
to give my dark, elegant personallity to my custom page, you know...

## Improvements

As I'm getting new to GitHub pages, I might do glitchy things and something like that :sweat_smile:, so if you find
somewhere I can improve my site, please tell me via an [issue](http://github.com/diddileija/diddileija.github.io/issues)
or a [pull request](http://github.com/diddileija/diddileija.github.io/pulls).
