# Find me on the Internet

As a developer, you can find me on several places, but I'll suggest you some good places to see
my activity.

## [GitHub](https://github.com)

Probably, GitHub is the most visited place by me. I have some repositories there, and that's were I made
my first contributions to the world... And I'm still working on projects hosted on GitHub.

You can find me as **@DiddiLeija**. [See my GitHub profile here](https://github.com/DiddiLeija).

## Sites inside [Python.org](https://python.org)

I have some accounts on many sites hosted by `python.org`. I listed them:

- [discuss.python.org](https://discuss.python.org/u/diddileija/summary)
- [bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/user39951)
- [python.org](https://www.python.org/users/DiddiLeija/)

(I'm also a PSF member).

## [PyPI](https://pypi.org)

I upload my packages to PyPI. My user profile is [here](https://pypi.org/user/DiddiLeija/).
